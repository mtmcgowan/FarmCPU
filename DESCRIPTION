Description: With substantial success in finding genes underlying human diseases and agriculturally
economic traits, Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) has been suffering two controversial problems: overwhelmed false positives and painful false negatives. Population structure and
Kinship among individuals can be incorporated as covariates in a Mixed Linear Model (MLM)
to control false positives. But the confounding problem between the covariates and test marker
also weakens the signals of QTNs (Quantitative Trait Nucleotides), resulting false negatives.
Here we present a user-friendly R GWAS package called FarmCPU (Fixed and random model
Circulating Probability Unification), it implemented a method we recently developed to address
the “confounding problem” and used several mathematical or programming strategies to increase
the speed and save memory in order to make FarmCPU adapted for big data. Now, FarmCPU
can deal with a data with 500,000 samples and 500,000 markers in three days.
